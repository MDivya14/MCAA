<pre>
Since the first item was sold over the internet in the 1990s, e-commerce has transformed how organizations do business across borders, thus reshaping the global economy. The expectation that businesses operate at least somewhat online, for example, bidding for contracts on a government portal or receiving funds through a mobile payment processor, has come to shape how the economy operates today. And in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, the global e-commerce market has grown exponentially. As of 2021, the e-commerce market had grown to represent USD 26.7 trillion.1

In the last 30 years, the online retail sector has come to encompass far more than just a small business selling goods in a browser-based e-commerce store. To compete and flourish in this vast ecosystem, organizations have deeply integrated e-commerce solutions with many of their business processes, allowing for holistic customer experiences across platforms and optimizations like automation and conversational analytics.

More recently, the e-commerce industry has transformed alongside advancements in AI. Where once the technology was considered a leading-edge improvement, today it's seen as a critical strategic advantage. According to a 2024 survey from Harvard Business Review Analytic Services, 70% of respondents believed it was very or extremely important to implement AI into their e-commerce processes. Simultaneously, 40% said their organization was actively using AI within their e-commerce operations. 2

History of e-commerce
The origins of e-commerce
While e-commerce has expanded to touch nearly every aspect of business, the first known sale by an e-commerce company occurred just two decades ago, when a New Hampshire-based online company sold a Sting CD for USD 12.48 plus shipping in 1994.2 In the two years following that transaction, both eBay and Amazon started. By December of 1999, the latter company had shipped 20 million items to 150 countries globally.3

The dot-com boom of the late 1990s saw a proliferation of e-commerce startups along with the development of online marketplaces and retail websites. During this time, payment platforms like PayPal were developed, paving the way for a new era of secure, instant online transactions. In 1996, both Samâ€™s Club and Wal-Mart debuted online stores.4 The e-commerce market matured through the early 2000s as other brick-and-mortar retailers recognized the importance of online shops to complement their physical businesses.
