<pre>
Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) are critical for optimizing how data is stored, accessed, and processed, directly affecting the performance of an application. This tutorial will guide you through the essential data structures and algorithms using the Java programming language.

Why Learn DSA in Java?
Java is a widely used, object-oriented, and platform-independent programming language that is particularly strong in building robust and scalable applications. Learning DSA in Java offers several benefits:

Memory Management: Although Java manages memory through garbage collection, understanding how data structures work in Java gives you insights into memory handling, which can help you write efficient programs.
Versatile: Java is known for its portability. Mastering DSA in Java makes it easier to transition to other object-oriented languages such as C++ or C#, as many modern languages share a similar syntax.
Object-Oriented: Java supports object-oriented programming (OOP) principles, which means you can easily implement data structures as classes, making your code modular, reusable, and more maintainable.
Strong Ecosystem: Java has a strong ecosystem for both web and mobile development, making it an excellent choice for building real-world applications using DSA concepts.
Prerequisite
Before diving into DSA with Java, you should be familiar with basic Java concepts. The following fundamental topics are prerequisites for learning DSA in Java:

Setting Up Java Development Environment: You need a working Java Development Kit (JDK) and an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA to write and run Java code.
Variables & Data Types: In Java, variables store data values, and each variable has a specific type, such as int, float, String, etc.
Basic Input and Output: Java allows input from users via the console, using classes like Scanner, and output through System.out.print and System.out.println.
Operators: Java provides a variety of operators like arithmetic, relational, logical, etc., for performing operations on variables.
Control Statements: Java supports decision-making statements like if-else and switch, as well as loops like for, while, and do-while.
Functions (Methods): Functions are blocks of code that perform specific tasks and can be called multiple times. Java supports both void and non-void methods.
Object-Oriented Concepts: Java is an object-oriented language, meaning you should know about classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.
Collections Framework: Java provides a rich set of data structures, like ArrayList, HashMap, LinkedList, etc., but itâ€™s recommended to implement your own data structures when learning DSA.
