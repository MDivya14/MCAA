<pre>
Computer organization focuses on the physical implementation and interconnection of hardware components within a computer system. It explores how the CPU, memory, and input/output devices are arranged and how they interact to execute programs. Essentially, while computer architecture defines what a system does, computer organization defines how it does it. 
Key aspects of computer organization include:
Hardware Components:
Understanding the CPU, memory (RAM and cache), input/output (I/O) devices, and their interconnections. 
System Interconnection:
Examining how these components are linked together, often through buses, to enable data and control signal transfer. 
CPU Organization:
Exploring different CPU architectures (e.g., single accumulator, general register, stack) and how they handle instructions and data. 
Memory Hierarchy:
Understanding the different levels of memory (cache, main memory, secondary storage) and their roles in performance. 
Input/Output Systems:
Learning about how data is transferred between the computer and external devices. 
Control Unit:
Investigating how the control unit manages and directs the operations of the other components.
