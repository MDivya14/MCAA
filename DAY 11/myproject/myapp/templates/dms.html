<pre>
A DBMS is a software application that manages and organizes a database. 
It provides tools for accessing, modifying, and managing data within the database. 
Examples of popular DBMS include MySQL, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, and PostgreSQL. 
Key Concepts in DBMS:
Databases:
Structured collections of data stored in electronic devices, which can be text, 
images, or other formats. 
Tables:
Relational databases store data in the form of tables, with rows representing records
 and columns representing attributes. 
SQL (Structured Query Language):
A standard language for accessing and manipulating data in relational databases. 
Data Types:
Different types of data, such as integers, dates, strings, etc., are used to 
define how data is stored in the database. 
Keys:
Primary keys uniquely identify each record in a table, while 
foreign keys link related tables together. 
Normalization:
A process of organizing data to reduce redundancy and improve 
data integrity, often by breaking down large tables into smaller, more manageable ones. 
Indexes:
Used to speed up data retrieval by creating a special lookup
 table that allows the database to quickly locate data based on a specific column or set of columns. 
Advantages of using a DBMS: 
Data Security: DBMSs provide strong security measures to protect data from unauthorized access. 
Data Integrity: They ensure data accuracy and consistency by enforcing rules and constraints. 
Data Independence: Users can access data without needing
 to know how it's physically stored. 
Scalability: DBMSs can handle large amounts of data and a growing number of users. 
Performance: They can optimize data retrieval and manipulation for better performance. 
Types of DBMS:
Relational DBMS (RDBMS): Uses tables and SQL for data management. 
NoSQL DBMS: Doesn't use SQL or tables, often using key-value pairs or document formats for data storage. 
Hierarchical DBMS: Stores data in a tree-like structure. 
Network DBMS: Uses a network model to link data elements. 
Object-Oriented DBMS (OODBMS): Supports object-oriented programming concepts for data management.
